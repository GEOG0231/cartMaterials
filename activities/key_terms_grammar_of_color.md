| | | All colors do not reach their maximum Chroma Strength at the same level of Value. [17] |  
| | | Colors differ by nature in their Chroma Strength, some being much more powerful that others. [17] |   
| | | If, however, instead of taking equal amount of the two colors, that is to say equal quantities of pigment or equal printed areas of each, we take what would correspond to an equal number of steps upon the scale of Chroma, we find that they do balance and produce a perfectly neutral gray, in which neither the one Hue nor the other predominates. [21] |  
| | | It does not matter at what point we draw the line, whether it is from one of the regular Hues or from a point between two Hues, if it passes through the center it will fall upon the Hue or intermediary Hue which is its strongest contrast. [19]|  
| | | Let us assume that Blue is required as one of the colors in a three-color combination. We find that its opposite Hue is Yellow-Red, and as this is merely and admixture of Yellow and Red, it follows logically that the use of these two Hues, with due regard to proportion of areas or strength of Chroma, will yield a perfect color Balance. [24] |   
| | | Now if we mixed equal parts of Red at is maximum Chroma with its opposite, Blue-Green, at its maximum, we could not get a perfectly neutral gray, but one in which the Red predominated very decidedly. [20] |
| | | One method is to choose a certain restricted field of Hues such as Yellow to Red, for example, and then select within this field regular steps of Hue, Value and Chroma which bear an orderly relation to each other. [24] |
| | | So we find that in order to balance two colors of unequal Chroma, but of the same Value, we use a larger area of the weaker Chroma with a lesser area of the stronger, and that the proportions are simply in inverse ratio to the strength of the Chroma of each. [22] |  
| | | The conclusion is that the _stronger Chroma and higher Value should occupy the lesser area and the weaker Chroma and lower Value should occupy the greater area._ [23] |
| | | The quality by which we distinguish a light color from a dark one. [15]|  
| | | The quality by which we distinguish one color from another, as a red from a yellow, a green, a blue or a purple. [14]|
| | | Thus we may consider a low Value of any Hue with a high Value of the same; or, a weak Chroma of any Hue with a stronger Chroma of the same. A more interesting combination within a single Hue is that of a low Value and weak Chroma with a high Value and stronger Chroma or vice versa. [24] |  
| | | We may avoid this danger in the selection of our color between these opposites by choosing steps of Chroma for them which shall be nearer to the neutral pole and approach to within, let us say, three steps of it. The line thus traced between opposite Hues will form an ellipse and colors taken anywhere on this line will safely accord. [25] |
| | | We may say of an emerald that it is green and that is is light, but we can say that certain grapes are green and also light, and yet there is a decided difference between their respective colors, if we place them side by side. Both may be green and of the same Value of light, but the emerald is _strong_ in color and the grape is _weak_ in color or _grayer_. [16]|
