## Make unigrid with InDesign  

This tutorial shows you how to use Adobe InDesign to plan your map layouts. As a model, we will use the National Park Service unigrid described in the [Typographic Standards](http://public.gettysburg.edu/~jrudy/type-standards.pdf) published by the Harper's Ferry Center. We will study these standards closely in a couple of weeks when we discuss typography, but for now please review the following pages that relate to layout design:  

- Page 6: <span style="color:FireBrick"> The grid </span>   
- Page 14: <span style="color:FireBrick">Low-profile layout </span>  
- Page 9: <span style="color:FireBrick"> Thumbnails </span>
