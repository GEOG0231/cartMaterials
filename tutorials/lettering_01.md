## 05A Map lettering (1): Working with type in AI  

This tutorial introduces you to tools and methods for working with type in Adobe Illustrator. Using a scratch artboard, the tutorial guides you through different types (or kinds) of type objects used by AI and then shows you how to change visual variables of type, how to place type along a line, and how to improve legibility of type through halos and knock outs.  

Please note that I produced these videos in 2020 and you will likely notice a few differences from the videos I have been producing this year. In 2020, I used a Windows machine rather than a Mac. I also used a different microphone setup so the sound is more muted than today, but hopefully still audible. Finally, you may notice some redundancies with content I produced this year, particularly in the "more ways to draw paths" video, but hopefully a little review at this point is not fatal.  

As you work through this playlist, please write down any vocabulary or jargon that you do not understand. In lecture on Monday, I will reserve some time to answer any questions about vocabulary and anything else in the playlist.
