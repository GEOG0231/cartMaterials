## Making custom styles in AI (Part 1)    

This tutorial shows you how to make custom styles in Adobe Illustrator for cartographic linework. This includes weights, textures (dashed or pecked lines), tapers (variable width), casings, inner glow, banded lines, water lines (ripples), and custom brushes. You will learn how to create these styles as graphic appearances that you can then save and reuse as graphic styles.  

Part 1 aims to be introductory, so we will just be drawing loosely on scratch paper. In a forthcoming installment, we will take a slightly more formal approach and develop our styles in a map taxonomy/style sheet that we then apply to our mapped geography.
